## Install

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.

You also need to install mysql server to run this locally.
- mySQL [download and install mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- macOs might be easier via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) then
```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install mysql
```

I recommend installing and using yarn package manager
```sh
$ npm install -g yarn
```

Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartinsantos/nem.git
```

Then run
```sh
$ npm install or $ yarn install
```


Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install mysql
```

## Run
It's very easy just run the following command
```sh
$ npm start or $ yarn start
```
Enjoy :D
